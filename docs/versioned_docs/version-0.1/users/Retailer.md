# Retailer
### The End-User of Tokenized Money via Connected Apps

In the S3.Money ecosystem, **retailers serve as the final users** of tokenized money, using it as a **payment solution for their own operations**. Unlike issuers and distributors, retailers have **no direct access to the S3.Money platform or dashboard**. Instead, they interact with **third-party apps connected to S3.Money’s infrastructure**, such as **payment apps** or **bank mobile apps**. These apps issue tokenized money that retailers can use to make payments or conduct internal transactions seamlessly.

### **How Retailers Operate in the S3.Money Ecosystem**

- **Access Tokens via Connected Apps:**
    Retailers receive tokenized money through **distributors’ apps**, including mobile apps provided by partner banks. These apps act as a bridge, allowing retailers to top up their token balances for easy and secure payments.
    
- **Payments Made Simple:**
    Retailers use tokenized money to **pay distributors or fulfill other financial commitments**. The tokenized payments, managed entirely through connected apps, allow retailers to operate efficiently without worrying about fiat-token reconciliation or treasury management.
    
- **Distributor-Managed Token Flow:**
    Retailers rely on distributors to **allocate and deallocate tokens** within the S3.Money system. Distributors handle the movement of tokens through their **Cash-In and Cash-Out Treasuries**, ensuring the retailer has access to the tokens they need, without having to interact with S3.Money directly.
