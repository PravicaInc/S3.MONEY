# Distributor
### The Token Custodian and Allocator

Distributors act as **the essential bridge between issuers and retailers**, managing the distribution and flow of tokenized money. Their primary responsibility is to receive tokens from issuers and allocate them to retailers for end-use. S3.Money streamlines the distributor’s tasks by integrating allocation and deallocation requests directly with bank transactions, ensuring every move is **transparent and verifiable**.

### **Distributor’s Core Responsibilities:**

- **Connection Requests:** Submit requests to connect with issuers and access their token supply.
- **Allocation Requests:** Request tokenized money from the issuer, with wired bank transactions attached automatically for seamless reconciliation.
- **Treasury Management:** Handle **Cash-In and Cash-Out Treasuries** to manage token flows between issuers and retailers.
- **Tracking and Reporting:** Monitor token allocations, usage, and transfers through the dashboard in real-time.
