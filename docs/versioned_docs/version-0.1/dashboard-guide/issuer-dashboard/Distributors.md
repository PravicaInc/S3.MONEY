### **Distributor Activity and Treasury Metrics**

1. **Distributor Treasury Balances**
    - View each distributor’s Held Supply (sum of Main, Cash-In, and Cash-Out Treasuries balances).
    - Real-time updates give issuers immediate insight into distributor reserves and circulation capacity.
2. **Circulation Metrics**
    - The **amount of circulated tokens** is shown for each distributor, calculated by subtracting the treasury balance from the allocated total, allowing issuers to gauge demand and distribution.
3. **Distributor Performance**
    - **Definition**: This metric calculates the **percentage of allocated tokens** that have moved beyond the distributor’s treasury into broader circulation, helping assess the effectiveness of token distribution.

    - **Interpretation**:
        - **High Percentage**: Indicates effective distribution and widespread token adoption within the ecosystem.
        - **Low Percentage**: May suggest potential issues in distribution strategy or limited token liquidity.
    - **Levels of Performance**:
        - **Dormant (0-20%)**: Low or no activity in distribution; tokens remain largely within the distributor’s treasury.
        - **Active (21-70%)**: Steady distribution and redemption activity, indicating consistent engagement.
        - **High-Volume (71-100%)**: Strong distribution and redemption, reflecting high demand and broad adoption.
    
    Tracking **Token Circulation Efficiency** allows issuers to pinpoint high-performing distributors and identify areas for potential improvement in token flow.
