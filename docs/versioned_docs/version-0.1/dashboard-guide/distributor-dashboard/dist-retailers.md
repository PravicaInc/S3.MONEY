# Retailers

The **Retailers** section provides tools for managing end-user wallet top-ups and off-ramps for future versions.

- **Manual Top-Ups**: Distributors can top up end-user wallets manually by entering the **end-userâ€™s wallet address** and **amount of tokens** to allocate. This feature is currently available for testnet purposes.
- **Future Request-Based System**: In the next release, top-ups will transition to a **request-based system**, similar to the issuer-distributor relationship, enabling distributors to streamline and automate end-user wallet transactions.
