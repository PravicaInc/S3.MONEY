# Supply details

This step involves adding the following details related to the supply of the stablecoin:

- **Initial supply**: Specify the initial number of stablecoin that will be minted (created). When you specify the initial number of stablecoins that will be minted, you are essentially setting the starting supply of your stablecoin. Only numbers are accepted in this field and the maximum character length is 11.

- **Supply type**: This indicates the maximum number of stablecoins that can exist throughout its existence. Users can choose between two options:

  - **Finite**: If the user opts for this, they also have to define a value for Max Supply. Setting the supply type to finite means the stablecoin can be minted up to a certain amount set as the Max Supply value. 
  Only numerical values are permitted in this field, and the maximum character limit is 11.

- **Decimals**: The user can set decimals to get more precision. This determines how divisible a token can be. The maximum allowed value for this field is 16.


After doing so, the user can move on to the next step, which involves granting permissions
