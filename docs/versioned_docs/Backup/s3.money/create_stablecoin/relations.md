# Relations
In this section, users can add new related wallets. By clicking on the **+ Add new relationship** button, they are presented with a dialogue where they can enter the name and address of the new sub-wallet. This allows users to track the number of coins allocated to each address.
The name of the wallet can also be updated later if necessary.
