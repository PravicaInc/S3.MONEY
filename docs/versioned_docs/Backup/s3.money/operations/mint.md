# Mint

To increase the supply of the stablecoin, the user can mint more coins by clicking on the mint box in the operations tab. After clicking, the user will be directed to a new screen where they have to enter the amount to be minted for the stablecoin. If the stablecoin has a finite supply, the main account address will be prefilled, and this address is where all minted tokens will be transferred. This account is the one used when initially creating the stablecoin.

It's important for the user to be cautious not to mint more tokens than the maximum supply value set for the stablecoin. All information related to the stablecoin, such as the current supply, supply after minting, and the maximum supply value, will be displayed on the right side of the screen.

In the case of an infinite supply, all minted tokens will be transferred to the connected account automatically.

After filling out the supply details, the user can click the mint button. They will then review the mint details in a new prompt and proceed with the operation once they confirm the details.
