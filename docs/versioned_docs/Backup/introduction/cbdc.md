# CBDC

A Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is a digital form of a country's fiat currency issued and regulated by the central bank. It operates within a centralized system and aims to provide the benefits of digital payments while maintaining the stability of traditional fiat currencies. CBDCs can be used for retail transactions or limited to wholesale interbank activities.

Similar to a stablecoin, a CBDC is designed to maintain a stable value relative to the fiat currency it represents, such as the US dollar or euro. Both CBDCs and stablecoins offer reduced volatility compared to other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Additionally, both CBDCs and stablecoins facilitate digital transactions and can enhance financial inclusion and efficiency in payment systems.

CBDCs and stablecoins are similar in their aim to provide stability and efficiency in digital transactions, with CBDCs being issued and regulated by central banks and stablecoins being issued by private entities or consortia.

A lot of the governments around the world are looking up to Stablecoin and crypto infrastructure providers for their CBDC initiatives and roll outs. Therefore, some of the key regulated Stablecoin issuers are also one of the top contenders for CBDC implementations.
