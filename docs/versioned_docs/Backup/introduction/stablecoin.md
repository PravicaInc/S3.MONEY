# Stablecoin

A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value relative to another asset, such as fiat currency like the US dollar or a commodity like gold. Unlike other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, whose values can fluctuate dramatically, stablecoins aim to minimize price volatility, making them more suitable for transactions, trading, and storing value.
Stablecoins achieve stability through various mechanisms, including:

1. **Fiat-Collateralized**: These stablecoins are backed by reserves of fiat currency (e.g., USD, EUR) held in a bank account or other forms of safekeeping. Each unit of the stablecoin is pegged to a corresponding unit of the fiat currency, ensuring a 1:1 value ratio.

2. **Crypto-Collateralized**: Some stablecoins are backed by other cryptocurrencies held as collateral. Smart contracts govern the issuance and redemption of these stablecoins to maintain price stability.

3. **Algorithmic**: Algorithmic stablecoins don't rely on collateral but rather use algorithms and monetary policies to control the coin's supply dynamically, aiming to maintain a stable value.

## Growth of StableCoins:

Stablecoins are the most explosive growth area within crypto. Stablecoins, settled $11 trillion onchain in 2022, and have continued to grow throughout 2023. They do nearly 10x the payment volume of PayPal and forced PayPal to launch their own Stablecoin and are now closing in on Visa’s payment volumes. There are nearly five million blockchain addresses that transact with stablecoins every week.


Some of the most commonly used Stablecoins today, backed by fiat collateral and US-T bills are:

**USDT**

USDT, or Tether, is a widely used stablecoin in the cryptocurrency market. It's designed to maintain a stable value relative to the US dollar, typically pegged 1:1. Issued by Tether Limited, USDT is claimed to be backed by reserves of traditional fiat currency, though transparency around this has been questioned. Despite criticism and regulatory scrutiny, USDT remains popular for trading, transferring value, and hedging against cryptocurrency volatility.

**USDC**

USDC, or USD Coin, is a stablecoin built on the Ethereum blockchain, pegged to the US dollar at a 1:1 ratio. Unlike USDT, it's issued by regulated financial institutions and undergoes regular audits for transparency. USDC is widely trusted for trading, transfers, and as a stable store of value due to its regulatory compliance, transparency, and stability.

**Paxos**

PAX is a digital asset pegged to the value of the US dollar on a 1:1 basis. It's regulated and approved by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), providing users with transparency and assurance regarding its backing.

**Binance USD**

Binance USD (BUSD) is a stablecoin issued in partnership with Paxos Trust Company, backed 1:1 by US dollars held in FDIC-insured bank accounts. It's designed to provide users with a stable digital asset for trading and transferring value within the Binance ecosystem.
These Stablecoins provide users with a means of accessing fiat currencies within the Binance ecosystem, facilitating trading, remittances, and other financial activities with reduced volatility compared to other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum.

**PayPal USD**

Issued by Paxos Trust Company, PayPal USD (PYUSD) is PayPal’s stablecoin designed for payments. PYUSD is an ERC-20 tokenized digital dollar and it is issued by Paxos Trust Company
